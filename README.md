# Twitch-Social-Network-Analysis

My project is about Twitch social network, which is basically an online platform where content creators can perform livestreaming and share a variety of content types.
As with any existent social network, we have creators, and we have followers. Both are considered users. However, this network is a representation of the relationships between the streamers.
The aim of having a twitch channel is to be able to interact with the viewers live. For instance, chatting and receiving donations or subscriptions. 


Goal of the project:

•	Perform Some interesting network analysis and discuss key statistics.
•	Use community detection techniques to perform social network analysis of twitch users.
•	Create visualizations for a graph of the network using Gephi.
•	Perform comparison between the English & the Portuguese (Brazil) networks.

Dataset explanation:

We have two csv files; one is composed of the nodes list with their attributes and the other file is a list links. The type of this network is undirected.
We are going to be focusing only on the English & Brazilian twitch channels as this will help us perform some interesting comparisons.


There are two folders:
  1) The code and csv files belonging to the English Twitch network
  2) The code and csv files belonging to the Brazilian Twitch network
